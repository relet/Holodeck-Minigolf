This is the first working codeset of the engine,
which itself is the result of a weekend trial-and-error session.

Don't expect to see code quality or documented parameters.

Requirements:
  - Webcam, projector
  - "Holodeck minigolf clubs", i.e. sticks that end in an 
    easily detectable black/white circle
  - python, python-pyode, python-opencv, python-pygame
  - an even, ideally white or white-ish surface

Watch the youtube video to get an idea what this is.
